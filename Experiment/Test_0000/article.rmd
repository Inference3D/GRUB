## Introduction ##

### What ###

Convolutional filters and correlation have a symmetrical relationship mathematically. Therefore I hypothesize that an image of even-sized and spaced shapes of different types can be correctly classified using convolution. I also hypothesize that the filters will appear to have similar patterns as the matching shapes. Finally, I hypothesize that adding rotation to the conditions will generate exciting ways in the convolution filter.  

### Why ###

The primary purposes of this experiment are the following:

* I want to verify that I can use _Genetic Algorithms_ (GA) to generate useful convolutional filters.
* I want to verify my intuition about convolutional filters.
* I want to experiment with convolutional filter refinement.
